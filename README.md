# pytorch-crypto

## Overview

This project demonstrates how use various data in crypto (e.q OHLCV, onchain_metrics, etc) collected from [data-collector repos](https://github.com/inotives/data-collectors) in machine learning models using PyTorch. Aims to experiments building models such as price predictors with various model like LSTM, etc.


## How to install
- Once clone the repos, cd into the project root folder and create a python virtual env.
```
python -m venv venv
```
- next, activate the virtual env using `source venv/bin/activate`
- once you activate your virtual env, make sure you are in the correct virtual evn `which python`
- then you can start to install the require packages. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
